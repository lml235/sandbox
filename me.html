    <h2>Figure Skating</h2>
        
            <p>Figure Skating has been a huge part of my life ever since I was a little kid. Starting when I was four years old I recall the first time I went figure skating on the small ice rink in the mall. It was so much fun and my parents asked me if I wanted to go to Bush Gardens or if I wanted to try skating lessons and I told them that I wanted to go skating. </p>
            <p>From there on forth I started to learn skating as a sport learning a variety of jumps and spins. When I was about 12 I started to go through the United States Figure Skating Association (USFSA) Test Levels. In the table bellow is a list of all of the skating test levels and the corresponding levels I have completed or is still in progress of completing.</p>

    <h2>Acting</h2>

  
        <p>I started getting into acting when I was about six years old. After taking a few classes I found that I really enjoyed acting. Soon after, I signed into a talent agency and booked my first job at the age of seven for a Rapunzel Huffy Bike Commerical. In the following years, I booked other notable jobs in both commerical, television, and internet broadcasts.</p>
